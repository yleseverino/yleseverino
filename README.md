# Hello!

I'm Yle, a mobile software developer living in Uberaba, Brazil.

With a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, I have the ability to easily adapt to different technologies. I am dedicated, passionate about delivering high-quality solutions.

I currently work at Gr√£o direto, developing a mobile app in Flutter. I've worked previously at Pax Deus √© grande, and the GTPlan.

I graduated from UFTM College in 2020 with a degree in electrical engineering with experience in France through Brafitec, in which I had the opportunity to study 2 periods at Polytech Lille in the computer science course.
